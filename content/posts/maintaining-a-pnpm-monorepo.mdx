# {frontmatter?.title}

Maintaining a public CLI, colors, and UI library has been significantly better after migrating to a PNPM monorepo.

[Source PNPM Monorepo](https://github.com/durksteedjr/packages).

## PNPM Monorepo

Because my public NPM packages are tightly integrated, keeping them co-located within a single repository greatly simplifies maintenance. PNPM has built-in support for monorepos with [PNPM Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

## Turborepo

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build) is an incremental build system and performant caching solution for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepos. It incrementally caches `package.json` scripts while running them in parallel execution, providing an incredibly smooth developer experience.

For example, consider the following Turborepo configuration:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

Turborepo can now run `build` in parallel execution for all packages while incrementally caching the `dist/**` output files:

```sh
pnpm turbo run build
```

## Changesets

[Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) manages package changelogs, publishing, and versioning. I use the [Changesets Bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) with GitHub Actions to automate the NPM workflow for all public packages in the monorepo.

## Structure

Below is an outline of my PNPM monorepo's structure:

```md

│ ├── cli
│ ├── colors
│ ├── ui
├── internal
| ├── sdk
│ ├── tsconfig
├── packages
